How to create a Windows installer for QRegExp-Editor
*******************************************************************************

Prerequisites:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Qt is installed
* MinGW is installed
* NSIS in installed
* CMake is installed
* QRegExp-Editor executable has already been build using CMake
	
How to build the installer:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
execute the provided build script:
build_installer.bat


Detailed Explanation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
QRegExp-Editor's windows installer is created using NSIS. You thus need to
install NSIS first if you want to build your custom windows installer for it.
You can download the latest version of the installer from the NSIS project
website located at http://nsis.sourceforge.net. Make sure the nsis compiler is
in PATH so it can be found by the command line interpreter.
Another requirement is that the project has already been built.

The installer script is called "qregexp-editor.nsi" and is located in the
dist/win directory. In order for the script to correctly produce binaries, it
needs to know where Qt and MinGW are installed and optinally whether the
executable is 32 or 64 bit. If you set those variables in your environment
they will be automatically detected by the batch script used to build the
installer. If not you are prompted for those values.

Setting the environment variables (optional):
set QTDIR="C:\Qt\4.7.1"
set MINGW="C:\MinGW"
set ARCH=32

There is also a variable VERSION which should ideally be automatically detected
by the build_installer.bat batch script. If that is not the case you can also
set it as an environment variable or you'll be prompted for it.

The resulting installer will be placed in the same directory where the nsis
script is located.
