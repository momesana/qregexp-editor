Installing QRegExp-Editor
*******************************************************************************
QRegExp-Editor uses CMake as build tool. If you are experienced in using
CMake, installation will be a breeze and doesn't need any further explanation.
Otherwise The steps to compile QRegExp-Editor are as follows:

Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all make sure that CMake is in PATH. If that's not the case add it to
it like so (assuming CMake was installed to C:\Program Files\CMake 2.8):
set "PATH=C:\Program Files\CMake 2.8\bin;%PATH%"

Now there are two ways to proceed with the installation, either using the
provided build script or doing it all manually!

Manual Approach:
1. The first step is to set these environment variables: QTDIR, MINGW and PATH.
   QTDIR points to the directory where Qt, and MINGW to the directory where
   MINGW is installed. PATH will be modified to contain the respective bin
   directories.
   
   set QTDIR=C:\Qt\4.7.1
   set MINGW=C:\MinGW
   set PATH=%MINGW%\bin;%QTDIR%\bin;%PATH%

2. Create a build directory and change into it:
   md build
   cd build

3. Run CMake:
   cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..

4. Build the project:
   make

Using the build script:
1. Execute build script:
   compile-win32.bat

Note:
If you have set the variables QTDIR and MINGW as described under the section
"Manual Approach" above, the script will detect and use those. Otherwise the
batch script will prompt you for the location where you have installed MinGW
and Qt respectively. You are strongly advised to set QTDIR and MINGW in your
environment if you want to repeatedly call the script since you won't have to
type in those values over and over again.


The resulting binary "qregexp-editor.exe" will be placed under build/src.

MacOSX and Linux
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. We assume that development binaries are in PATH and can be found by CMake.
Otherwise you should modify the PATH variable accordingly.

2. Create a build directory and change into it:
   mkdir build
   cd build

3. Run CMake:
   cmake ..

4. Build the project:
   make

The resulting binary "qregexp-editor" will be placed under build/src.
